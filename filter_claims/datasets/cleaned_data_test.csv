So , pretty bad . 	0
Not bad like murderer bad—but bad like ruining-one-of-our-nation ’ s-most-essential-institutions-in-order-to-get-what ’ s-best-for-your-kid bad . 	0
You are a bad person if you send your children to private school . 	1
Your children and grandchildren might get mediocre educations in the meantime , but it will be worth it , for the eventual common good . 	0
It could take generations . 	0
This would not happen immediately . 	0
But it seems to me that if every single parent sent every single child to public school , public schools would improve . 	0
The report that an increasing number of parents in this country are seeking to homeschool their children is not at all surprising . 	0
However , some persons expressed confusion about this admission from an official of the Ministry of Education recently , because of the high standard of education we afford our children at the nursery , primary and secondary levels . 	0
But rich people will always find a way to game the system : That shouldn ’ t be an argument against an all-in approach to public education any more than it is a case against single-payer health care . ) 	0
( Yes , rich people might cluster . 	0
The media coverage here and abroad about bullying , teasing as well as physical and emotional abuse in public schools is abundant , and it could make a parent want to protect their children from that bad environment . 	0
Certainly there are advantages and disadvantages to homeschooling and if it is an area that is gaining currency in this country , the relevant authorities will need to do some probing to ensure that parents are giving their children instruction in the right manner , and are not in fact putting their children at a disadvantage . 	0
Unless there are individual circumstances I wouldn ' t be sending my children to a single sex school . 	1
Indeed , if homeschooling is really on the rise , Government may have to seek parliamentary approval to institute laws and regulations to govern this method of teaching . 	0
Yet most slum dwellers would much prefer their governments to open schools . 	0
Low-cost private schools thrive in very particular contexts ; for example , they flourish in illegal slum settlements in marginal urban areas , where governments fail to provide public schools because they do not recognise the settlements . 	0
Simple analysis shows that this is the result of the government failing to invest in education . 	0
Low-cost private schools are also evident in other contexts : for example , where government services are largely absent , such as in rural Pakistan . 	0
In doing this , the DFID is following in the ideological footsteps of the World Bank . 	0
Over the past three years , the Department for International Development ( DFID ) has made the controversial move to support low-cost private schools in some countries , such as Nigeria , Ghana , or Pakistan , where public education systems are in desperate need of investment . 	0
This begs the question of whether or not is it a good use of public money from UK taxpayers to invest speculatively in for-profit private schools in poor countries ? 	0
Indeed , a recent DFID Guidance Note on low-cost private schools argues that such schools have a key role to play in expanding education provision , despite acknowledging the fact that “ there is still a lack of data and comparative analysis on education outcomes to assess value for money ” . 	0
In this context DFID ought to be making the case for increased domestic investment , as it is the only sustainable solution . 	0
Pakistan spends only 2 . 4% of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) on education against a benchmark of good practice of 6% of GDP . 	0
What a hypocritical message we send to our children when we allow laws to be passed which limit the free expression of speech in public by banning public prayer in classrooms . 	0
Federal and Supreme Court judges should be impeached who undermine the freedom upon which this country was founded . 	0
But that ' s a whole bag opened : why do some parents not care ? 	0
On the other hand , some parents were fabulous , agreeing to hand me the leads to the X-Box until I decided the work had improved , or calling on my phone in my lesson to check up . 	0
That , not race , is the difference . 	0
It ' s not something I expect to improve under this government , which has already basically written off a whole sector of society as not worth it . 	0
It ’ s a lesson I sadly suspect our nation ’ s educators will never learn . 	0
The fervency with which school prayer is opposed is not because the ACLU ( an anti-Christian legal group ) is trying to protect atheist from being indoctrinated by religion . 	0
Humanism assumes that the supernatural does not exist and that reality must be discovered purely from man ' s reasoning . 	0
Our public school system has been operating on this foundation since prayer was removed in 1962 . 	0
Since prayer was eliminated from public schools , the quality of education has shown a steady statistical decline . 	0
Is there a link between the two ? 	0
It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time . 	0
His mum doesn ' t send him to school because she worries he ' ll get bullied . 	0
Returning prayer to school would be an affront to this philosophy because prayer acknowledges the existence of someone greater than man . 	0
Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard . 	0
As much as I hate a lot of things that happen in public education , give me that stupidity over the utter lunacy of teaching kids about invisible father figures in the sky . 	0
Of course , then they could learn about the earth being flat and that big flood too . 	0
You mean when most children weren ' t educated at all , they just worked on their parent ' s farm and a large percentage never learned to read or write ? 	0
Let ' s face facts , if we did away with public education , most private schools are religious these days , that ' s where people would have to turn . 	0
I know that there are plenty of homeschoolers who turn out just fine . . . but I ' ve never met them in reality . 	0
Again , I do apologize if anyone finds this offensive in any way . 	0
Because I was never allowed to socialize with them as a child . 	0
Why ? 	0
One was the youngest in his class . 	0
By the way I taught in the public schools for over twenty-five tears . 	0
Academically he did great , valedictorian when he graduated . 	0
I held him back because he couldn ' t sit still . for 2 minutes . 	0
The other is the 2nd oldest in his class . 	0
After thousands of bedtime stories and hundreds of trips to the library , books were only as good as the pictures . 	0
In fact , The National Home Education Research Institute ( NHERI ) reports that homeschoolers actually participate in approximately five different social activities outside the home on a regular basis : boy / girl scouts , dance , swimming lessons , Sunday School , 4-H , homeschool co-ops , sports , theater , music classes and field trips . 	0
Boys were beastly enough without the distraction of girls , and the educational needs of girls were thought to diverge from those of boys even before puberty brought its complications . 	0
Early advocates of coeducation like Bronson Alcott were thought to be batty . 	0
While the debate goes on about the legitimacy of single-sex classes and schools in the public sector , private and independent schools keep taking the concept to whole new levels . 	0
Once upon a time coeducation was unthinkable . 	0
As a kid I experienced both single-sex and coeducational schools . 	0
My public elementary school was coed , of course , and then I had six years of boys-only junior and senior high school . 	0
Plenty of progressive educators and theorists have since laid to rest most of the traditional concerns and fears of coeducation skeptics . 	0
Public schools have been coed for a long time , and old schoolhouses with separate  Boys "" and "" Girls "" entrances are quaint in a way that makes us shake our heads . ",0
